This milestone was critical in my learning process because I was able to understand how the ultrasonic sensor worked; The trigPin, or the "left eye" sends out a sound wave which has a frequency above what can be registered by the human ear. As it sends the wave outward, it starts a timer. The timer ends when the wave bounces off the nearest object in the wave's path and is recieved by the echoPin/"right eye". I made it so that if the nearest object was within 10 centimeters of the sensor's range, the light would blink. I'll link my code below in a github repository for all my milestones. This was a really fun milestone because I could see the results of my work pretty quickly. The main benefit of this is that I gained most of my familiarity in the Arduino IDE software which will be a big use in my upcoming milestones. 

# Second Milestone
Motors are sensitive to input from the ultrasonic sensor
